# Tendon_Limb_Design_2


The goal of this respository is to show the design behind a Tendon-Driven leg following this basic steps:

Run main:

%% Main 

%Run this code to get the main figure showing the angle changes and fesible forse set for a leg movement during a ground %stage.

% Code to add leg dimensions, both segments the same size. 
% code to add motor parameters, forces and the scaling of the feasible force set to fit into figure
% Locations of knee and end point are calulated. (q1 position and floor location)
% CALLED FUNCTIONS: 
% This file calls the function MeasureAngle.m to calculate joint angles
%       Calculated angles have been tested, they are correctly obtained
% it also calls function Tendon_Limb_Design.m to get the feasible force set
%       Still need to determine if gotten feasible force set is good 

%Headers in MATLAB files help on explaining the function of this code.


# Notes:


Transformation matrix (T) __Kinetic description

Forward kinematic model G(q) __End point position with orientation also called Geometric Model

Jacobian (J) __Instantaneous linear and angular endpoint velocities

Moment arm matrix (R(q)) __From a given tendon route and joint radius

Maximum force matrix (F)__Where forces generated by motors go, motor shafts will produce torque values below the stall ones because of movement

Activation matrix a __Show the current activation level of muscles

Feasible wrench space: __w=J[-trnasp]RF*a=Ha

# Room for improvement


% A lot of optimization is possible. More atrix operations (linear
% algebrea) can be used.
